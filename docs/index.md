# Open Architecture Standards

Welcome to the **Open Architecture Standards (OAS)** documentation!

## What is OAS?

Open Architecture Standards (OAS) is a lightweight, LLM-friendly schema for describing architectural layouts, programs, rooms, walls, and openings using simple JSON in millimeter coordinates. It's designed for:

- 🤖 **Generative design** - Enable AI-powered architectural design
- ✏️ **Editing by prompts** - Modify designs using natural language
- 🌐 **Easy rendering** - Simple integration with web tools

## Key Features

- **Simple JSON Format**: Easy to read, write, and parse
- **Millimeter Precision**: Accurate coordinate-based descriptions
- **LLM-Friendly**: Designed for seamless AI integration
- **Web-Ready**: Built for modern web rendering tools

## Quick Start

Get started with OAS by exploring our documentation:

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) - Learn the basics
- [Specification](specification/overview.md) - Dive into the details
- [Examples](specification/examples.md) - See OAS in action

## Use Cases

OAS is perfect for:

- **Architectural Design Tools**: Build AI-powered design applications
- **Space Planning**: Automate layout generation and optimization
- **Visualization**: Create interactive floor plans and 3D models
- **Documentation**: Standardize architectural data representation
