# About

## About Open Architecture Standards

Open Architecture Standards (OAS) is an open-source specification designed to standardize the representation of architectural layouts in a machine-readable format.

## Project Goals

### 1. Standardization
Create a common format for architectural data that works across different tools and platforms.

### 2. AI Integration
Enable seamless integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered design tools.

### 3. Simplicity
Keep the specification simple and easy to implement while maintaining enough expressiveness for real-world use cases.

### 4. Web-Native
Design for modern web technologies and easy rendering in browsers.

## Use Cases

OAS is designed for:

- **Generative Design Tools**: AI systems that create architectural layouts
- **Space Planning Applications**: Tools for optimizing room layouts and space usage
- **Visualization Software**: Applications that render floor plans and 3D models
- **Data Exchange**: Standardized format for sharing architectural data between systems
- **Documentation**: Clear representation of architectural designs

## Technical Features

### JSON-Based
- Standard JSON format for easy parsing
- Compatible with all modern programming languages
- Human-readable and editable

### Millimeter Precision
- All coordinates in millimeters
- Accurate dimensional representation
- Suitable for both planning and construction

### Extensible
- Support for custom properties
- Modular design
- Version-controlled evolution

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community!

### How to Contribute

1. **Feedback**: Share your thoughts and suggestions
2. **Examples**: Contribute example layouts and use cases
3. **Documentation**: Improve the documentation
4. **Tools**: Build tools and libraries that support OAS

## Acknowledgments

This specification is inspired by other successful open standards in the software industry, including:

- OpenAPI Specification (for API design)
- JSON Schema (for data validation)
- GeoJSON (for geographical data)

## Version History

### 1.0.0 (Current)
- Initial release
- Core schema definition
- Basic room, wall, and opening support
- Documentation and examples

## Roadmap

Future considerations:

- 3D support (floor levels, heights)
- Enhanced opening types
- Material specifications
- Furniture and fixtures
- MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) elements
- Building information modeling (BIM) integration
